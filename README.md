# Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023Â¶

## Overview
This project analyzes data from the "Aviation Accident Database & Synopses" dataset to identify the safest and most cost-effective aircraft for a company looking to expand into the aviation industry. By reviewing accident and incident data, aircraft safety records, maintenance issues, and operational contexts, the project aims to provide actionable insights for minimizing risks and optimizing operational efficiency.

## Business Understanding
As the company diversifies its portfolio into the aviation sector, it faces significant risks associated with aircraft safety, maintenance costs, and operational efficiency. Selecting the right aircraft is crucial for ensuring the success of this new business endeavor. The aviation industry is highly competitive and regulated, requiring careful consideration of multiple factors to ensure safe, reliable, and cost-effective operations.

## Data Understanding
The "Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023" from Kaggle is a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about aviation accidents and incidents. This dataset provides critical insights into various aspects of aviation safety and operational efficiency. For our analysis, we focus on the following key components of the dataset:

Accident and Incident Data: This includes detailed records of aviation accidents and incidents, encompassing data points such as the date, location, and severity of each event
Aircraft Information: Details about the aircraft involved in each accident or incident, including model, manufacturer, and registration.

Synopsis: Brief summaries of each accident or incident, providing context and initial findings. Cause and Contributing Factors: Information on the identified causes and contributing factors for each event.

Human Factors: Data on pilot and crew performance, errors, and other human-related aspects. Weather Conditions: Weather data at the time of each accident or incident.

Operational Context: Information about the flight phase (e.g., takeoff, cruise, landing) and operation type (e.g., commercial, private, cargo).
